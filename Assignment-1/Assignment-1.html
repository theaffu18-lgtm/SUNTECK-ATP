        This is my first <strong>paragraph</strong> in my new <em>webpage</em>. 
        This is going to be great. I am so excited I can hardly contain 
        <strong>myself</strong>. Don't you just love paragraphs? 
        I find them very useful.

    <h1>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h1>

    <p>
        Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. 
        Learning how to create web pages is easy and <strong>entertaining.</strong> 
        This is my second<em>paragraph</em>. I hope you like it.
